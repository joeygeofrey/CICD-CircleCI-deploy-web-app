## Project Scope

Implement a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for the UdaPeople product, in order to improve software development efficiency and reduce the risk of errors in production. The pipeline will be integrated with the existing source code management system and will be triggered by code changes pushed to the repository. Automated tests will be set up to run at various stages of the pipeline, and the pipeline will be configured to fail if any tests fail. The pipeline will be configured to deploy to production only after all tests have passed. This project will include the monitoring and reporting of pipeline performance and issues



## Deliverables

CI/CD Proposal: A presentation which translates the techincal and financial benefits of implementing CI/CD for the UdaPeople software.

CI/CD Pipeline: An automation pipeline that builds, tests, deploys and monitors the UdaPeople software.
